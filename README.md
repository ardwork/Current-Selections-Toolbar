<h2>Qlik Sense Current Selections Object with Action Buttons</h2>
<br>
<br>
A very simple Qlik Sense extension that allows users to show the selections currently set in an application. This has been requested for use cases where exporting / printing a sheet or story to PDF or Powerpoint and the selections are required to be shown. You can show and hide the buttons you require to allow users to manange the selections, to a limited extent, from this object.

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
There are no instructions, simply drag the 'Current Selections' object onto your sheet and give it a Title as you require.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Testing</h3>
Tested with Qlik Sense 2.2.* and 3.1.* <br>
Note: At the time of testing extensions do not print to PDF or PowerPoint and appear as invalid object areas. This will hopefully be addressed soon to allow the full fuctionality of export sheets and stories to be available across extensions.<br>

<h3>Comments</h3>
1. On initial opening the 'No Current Selections' message is repeated 3 times. If anyone has a solution for this I'd be interested as I have not been able to resolve it.
<br>
<br>
2. In Qlik Sense Desktop the CSS does not change the rendering in this object. The above screenshots are from the browser URL, the desktop currently renders as below.
